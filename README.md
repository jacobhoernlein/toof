# toofbot

A Discord bot written in Python using the discord.py module. Includes role menus and cute dog pics.

If you would like to test this yourself, make sure to add the proper tokens for Discord and Tweepy into the proper environment variables.

The bot will create a database for you, but as of now, you must manually populate the values in the guilds table for the bot to run properly.
